## The Martian Castaway

### Introduction

Many years ago, Andy Weir released the Martian.  There was a certain magic to it, and it got folks asking a lot of important questions.  At this time I was already deeply fascinated with space, but it got me asking questions like the ones asked in the move.  Namely, if you were stranded on Mars with no hope of rescue, how would you survive?  What technologies would be required?  What would you need to build and develop, and what are the minimum starting resources required for survival?

This project sets out to begin answering some of these questions (to the best of my ability).  In the chapters below, I will be taking the role of a castaway martian, marooned on a strange planet with nothing but minimal gear and his own wits to keep him alive.

I make a few assumptions in most of my explanations.  Namely that you have a high school level understanding of Calculus, some basic matrix math, and some basic experience with programming (Python and some C++).  Some of the articles may be beyond these prerequisites though, but they will be marked as such so feel free to skip them.
