### About

My name is Nathan Heidt.  I'm an engineer primarily working in robotics systems in the space sector.  More specifically I focus on control and planning for flight payloads.  The Martian Castaway has been a passion project I've wanted to do for some time and serves as a way for me to document my projects in a fun way.  Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or ideas.  I hope you enjoy!
