I'm...in trouble.  Again.  This stupid shuttle's stupid life support system can't keep up.  The original crew must have 'salvaged' a significant chunk of the scrubbers for 'parts' (I think they sold them).  I guess they only expected this thing to be on it's own air for a few days at a time max.  I probably have another week before the CO2 concentration is too high and I'm SOL.  Evaluating my options here:

* If I can get my hands on enough water, I can setup a sebatier reaction - problem is, I don't have the necessary tools for that, although if I ever want to make propellant I'll need to do it someday
* I can try to get some of these seeds going - this would be a good long term solution, I'll especially need it for food, but I don't think they'll grow fast enough to sequester the CO2
* I can vent the shuttle - I hate this idea, but if I vent the shuttle I can use the fresh reserve air, but I think that will put me back where I started.

I need some time to think...

I think I still have some luck left.  The crew that managed this shuttle before me must have gone cheap on the potable water refill.  I had a glass sitting out in the cabin for a couple days (whoops), and I noticed a tinge of green.  Algae!  (I hope).  I can grow algae very quickly and it's very efficient at sequestering carbon.  I'm not sure of the species, but this is a big stroke of fortune.  Many forms of algae are even edible so I might be able to use this to replenish my food stock.  In fact, a lot of them are high in fats and I have a lot of uses for naturally produced oils.  I should probably build a microscope at some point to figure out the strain, but for now I'll see what I can do with this little sample.

### Bioreactors
I'm going to need to build a bioreactor for this.  More or less an algae aquarium.  I'll need a light source, an aeration source, and a few sensors to ensure everythings working (specifically a CO2 sensor).  Once I have a basic setup, I'll want to determine optimal lighting and aeration cycles and go from there.  Fortunately algae are pretty easy to grow, so it should be pretty hard to screw up.
