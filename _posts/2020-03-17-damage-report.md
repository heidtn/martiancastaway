Things have gone very, very wrong.

A micrometoroid storm hit my transport ship tearing the thing to near shreds.  After the main torch engine was disabled, I fled in a shuttle like the others.

Luck, the saucy minx, deemed me unworthy of an easy escape and the primary control system on the shuttle was completely destroyed.  No Guidance, navigation, and control (GNC); no communication; no nothing.

I drifted for weeks (earth standard), before I began to approach an unfamiliar planetary body.  Something on the outer reaches I'm sure. In a backwater system like this, I'd be willing to bet it barely gets a visitor a century.  Even so, I guess Luck was listening for once.  The chances of accidentally getting caught in a planets gravity well is astronomically low.

I'm running out of supplies, and I can't last up here forever.  I think my only option at this point...is down.  Before I do that, I need to learn about the planet and take stock of my situation.


### The Planet
While my GNC might be out, the ships distributed systems seem mostly functional, including the sensors.  Here's what I know about the planet so far:

The primary chemical composition of the regolith seems to be:

| Element | Percentage |
|-------|--------|---------|
| SiO<sub>2</sub> | 42% |
| Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> | 18.5% |
| CaO | 6% |
| SO<sub>3</sub> | 7% |
| Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> | 7% |
| Other trace minerals | 19.5% |

Some good stuff there, lots of raw materials that will make rebuilding easier.  

The atmosphere also seems to have a similar makeup to mars, with the major expection being that atmospheric density is 1 ATM earth standard

| Element | Percentage |
|-------|--------|---------|
| CO<sub>2</sub> | 95.32% |
| N | 2.7%|
| Ar | 1.6%|
| O | 0.13%|

That's unfortunate, but not unexpected.  The universe is mostly inhospitable to life.  I guess I'm just fortunate this planet isn't on fire.

Also, there seems to be minor amounts of: water, nitrogen oxide, neon, hydrogen-deuterium-oxygen, krypton and xenon

I'm also detecting a lot of minerals in the forms of feldspar, pyroxenes and olivine.  These could prove very useful.

### My Supplies
Thankfully the shuttle is well stocked for long duration survival, I have some supplies and tools:
* A shelter - a decently sized living space, approximately the size of, you know, a human apartment, maybe?  I have enough oxygen and food for several months, but it won't last forever.
* Solar power - I have a small solar panel and battery that I can use to power tools and experiments.  I'll assume that, while I don't have unlimited power, I have effectively unlimited capacity.
* Basic tools (electronic and mechanical tools) - things like soldering irons, drills, screwdrivers, electronics testing tools, etc.
* A 3D printer - a printer capable of simple plastic parts that I can design.
* Basic mechanical components - screws, aluminum channel, dowels, gears, etc.  Though these may be limited and I may be forced to find rawmaterials for more
* The last thing (my little bit of sci-fi rules stretching) is a (magical) electronics printer.  Something that can provide things like microcontrollers, sensors, motors, etc.

### What do I do next?
Iâ€™ll be tackling things in order:
* orbital mechanics - how do I write code that can calculate orbits and landings for a ship?
* CO2 sequestration - how do I generate clean, breathable air?
* food farming - how do I get food?
* tools and resource collection - how do I generate and/or refine raw materials?
* water collection - how can I obtain or recycle clean drinking water?
* power generation - I'll hit power limits eventually, what do I do then?
* exploration - I can't stay in one place forever, I'll need rarer resources
* communication - Eventually I'll need to get off this rock, how can I call for help?
* and much more.
