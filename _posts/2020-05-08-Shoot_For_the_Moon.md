**SHIPLOG #0005 T+2120-05-07T13:24:39.2130184**
Things are going way too smoothly for me right now, but I might as well ride this gravy train.  I've got a navigation system online, a big part of my Guidance Navigation and Control (GNC) system.  Next step is guidance.  Now that I've identified a good landing location, the next step is getting my ship there, but how do I do that?  Well I'm going to split it up into two stages:
* Initial Burn - this gets me in the general proximity of the location I want to land
* Soft Landing - this accounts for any error in the initial burn and also ensures a soft landing in the most efficient way possible
